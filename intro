hi My name is gitanjali. Currently i am doing PhD in list on the vegetation atmospere intreaction 
The Land-Atmosphere system consists of different compartments such as: soil, the vegetation
canopy, the atmospheric boundary layer and the troposphere (Wulfmeyer et al., 2018). Land-
Atmosphere (L-A) interaction takes place through the exchange of gases, energy, and water between
these different compartments. The role of vegetation in the exchange process is significant as it
contributes to 50% of the water vapor on land through transpiration (E) and almost all atmospheric
oxygen through carbon assimilation(A). Additionally, vegetation also contributes towards the total
energy balance of the land surface through energy partitioning into sensible and latent heat flux. The
vegetation-air interaction begins at the leaf surface controlled by stomata and significantly affects
the atmospheric boundary layer fluxes at landscape or canopy scale (which is controlled by canopy
conductance). The processes of transpiration, assimilation, and leaf-energy exchange are coupled
and studied together as leaf-gas energy exchange. The evaluation of vegetation atmosphere
interaction in not easy due to the associated micro meteorological feedback. The four well-known
feedbacks are : 1.Transpiration leaf temperature feedback (E changes with leaf temperature and leaf
temperature changes with E), 2. Transpiration air humidity feedback (E changes with air humidity
and air humidity changes with E), 3.Sensible heat and air temperature feedback (as shown in figure
1b) (sensible heat changes with air temperature and air temperature changes with sensible heat), 4.
Assimilation and CO2 concentration in air(A) changes with CO2 concentration in air and CO2
concentration changes with (A).
The forces and the coeffecient
The driving force for the exchange of mass and energy from the leaf to air is the concentration(co 2
&water vapor)and the temperature difference existing between the leaf and its adjacent air layer
(known as leaf boundary layer). The mass and energy flux are estimated by product of temperature/
concentration difference and the flux transfer coefficient as shown in equations below (1,2,3).
During transpiration, the water vapor diffuses from the sub-stomatal region to the leaf surface and
then through convection into the atmosphere and during assimilation CO2 diffuses into the stomata
from the surrounding air as shown in figure 1a (Schuepp, 1993).
